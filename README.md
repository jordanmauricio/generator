#Stamp Generator

This is a very small and simple (read: no styling) app that allows users to upload photos, which will be processed and a logo will be applied to it. The idea behind this application was for its use in a greater marketing campaign for "Stanislaus Brewskovitch", it would be used for their Winter Wonderland Beer Festival, where users would upload their photo and Stanislaus could then re-post them on its Instagram feed. 

The challenge was mostly mathematical in getting the proper ratios correct when resizing the images while processing them. Everything is inside the **js/imagepreview.js** file.
